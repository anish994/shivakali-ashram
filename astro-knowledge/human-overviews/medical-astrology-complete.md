# Medical Astrology — Human Overview

Hook:
A reflective map for care, not a diagnosis. Use patterns to ask better questions — with real doctors in the loop.

Why it matters:
Linking temperament, routines, and timing to health nudges preventive care and kinder habits.

Scientific cool:
- Lifestyle medicine: sleep, stress, diet, movement drive outcomes.
- Chronobiology: timing affects meds, mood, and metabolism.
- Psychoneuroimmunology: mindset and relationships modulate immunity.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Tibb emphasizes balance, cleanliness, and ethical care.
- Christianity: Healing framed as compassion + wisdom + community.
- Sanatan Dharma: Ayurveda integrates constitution, season, and conduct.

Mini case:
Scheduling heavy tasks earlier + evening wind-down reduced migraines.

Level-up Quests:
- Track sleep/water/steps for 14 days; note patterns.
- Align one habit with your most reliable energy window.
- Book a checkup you’ve postponed.

Safeguards:
Not medical advice. Never delay, prevent, or replace professional care.
