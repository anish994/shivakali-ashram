# Sound Healing — Human Overview

Hook:
From temple bells to church choirs to Sufi qawwali — humans tune the mind by tuning the air. Sound changes state. Quickly.

Why it matters:
Rhythm and resonance entrain brainwaves and physiology. The right soundscape can lower stress, improve sleep, and open emotion safely.

Scientific cool:
- Music therapy meta-analyses: reduced pain, anxiety, and improved mood across conditions.
- Binaural beats: modest evidence for state shifts (focus/relax) when paired with intention.
- Vagal toning: humming/chanting stimulates vagus via vocal resonance.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Qawwali and devotional nasheeds evoke ecstatic remembrance and cohesion.
- Christianity: Gregorian chant calmed monastic life and marked sacred time.
- Sanatan Dharma: Nada Yoga and mantra japa — sound as a path to silence.

Mini case:
Night routine swap: news → 10 minutes of low-frequency drone + soft mantra; sleep latency halved in a week.

Level-up Quests:
- 7-breath hum: hum on the exhale, feel chest-face resonance.
- One-song reset: same calming track before hard tasks.
- Sacred replay: pick one chant from any tradition for a week.

Safeguards:
Keep volume safe. If sound triggers grief or agitation, use gentler textures or pause.
