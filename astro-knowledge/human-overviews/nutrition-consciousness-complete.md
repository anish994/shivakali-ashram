# Nutrition & Consciousness — Human Overview

Hook:
Food is information. Eat like a keyboard warrior or a temple caretaker — your brain will notice.

Why it matters:
Stable blood sugar, micronutrients, and gut health map directly to mood, focus, and resilience.

Scientific cool:
- Mediterranean-pattern diets linked to lower depression risk.
- Omega‑3s (EPA/DHA) support mood regulation in meta-analyses.
- Gut-brain axis: fiber and fermented foods improve microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Sunnah celebrates moderation and wholesome foods.
- Christianity: Fasting/feasting cycles sanctify appetite and attention.
- Sanatan Dharma: Sattvic principles — clarity-supporting foods.

Mini case:
Breakfast swap to protein + fiber → afternoon crashes vanished in a week.

Level-up Quests:
- Add a vegetable at lunch daily.
- Protein at breakfast target.
- 2 fermented servings/week.

Safeguards:
Medical conditions? Personalize with a clinician.
