# Ayurveda Medical Science — Human Overview

Hook:
Not a fad diet — a 2,000+ year operating system for bodies. Eat, sleep, move, and think in rhythm with nature, not against it.

Why it matters:
Ayurveda’s dosha-guided living offers practical levers (diet, spices, routines) to improve digestion, energy, and mood — with strong overlap to modern chronobiology and nutrition science.

Scientific cool:
- Circadian alignment (dinacharya) echoes Nobel-winning circadian biology.
- Spices (turmeric, ginger) with documented anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits.
- Yoga + diet interventions show improvements in metabolic and mental-health markers.

Story Triad:
- Islam: The Prophetic tradition values moderation, fasting, and wholesome foods.
- Christianity: Monastic rules emphasize simple, seasonally appropriate meals.
- Sanatan Dharma: Charaka/Sushruta outlined personalized medicine long before precision health.

Mini case:
Swapping dinner → earlier/lighter + ginger tea; bloating calmed, mornings sharper in 10 days.

Level-up Quests:
- Dosha guess: note your "too hot / too cold / too ungrounded" trends for a week.
- Spice trio: cumin-coriander-fennel tea after lunch.
- Sunset cut-off: stop heavy food 3 hours before bed.

Safeguards:
Use common-sense, personalized adjustments. Medical conditions? Coordinate with a clinician.
