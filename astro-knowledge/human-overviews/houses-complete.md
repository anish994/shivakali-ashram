# Houses (Bhavas) — Human Overview

Hook:
The 12 rooms of life: identity, resources, communication, home, joy, service, partnership, death/rebirth, belief, career, community, solitude.

Why it matters:
Houses map where stories play out. Seeing which rooms are noisy vs. neglected helps balance effort and attention.

Scientific cool:
- Behavioral focus: structuring life domains reduces overwhelm.
- Planning psychology: domain clarity improves goal follow-through.
- Journaling across domains increases self-awareness.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Rights of self, family, neighbors — balanced life as faith in action.
- Christianity: Vocation and stewardship across spheres of life.
- Sanatan Dharma: Purusharthas (dharma/artha/kama/moksha) echo house clusters.

Mini case:
Realizing a 6th-house overload, Leena cut commitments and her health rebounded.

Level-up Quests:
- Score each house 1–10 this week.
- Pick one underfed house; add a 10-minute habit.
- Prune one overgrown house; say no once.

Safeguards:
Don’t label a house “bad.” Focus on stewardship, not stigma.
