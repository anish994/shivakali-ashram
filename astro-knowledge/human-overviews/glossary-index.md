# Glossary — Human Overview

Hook:
Speak the language, shrink the distance. A few terms unlock a library.

Why it matters:
Definitions make the rest feel human. No jargon walls; just short bridges.

Scientific cool:
- Retrieval practice: look-up → use → remember.
- Chunking: learn clusters (nakshatra/lagna/rashi) together.
- Multimodal: read aloud once — better recall.

Story Triad:
- Across traditions: words matter; so does kindness in how we use them.

Mini case:
Learning “antardasha” clarified a year of notes.

Level-up Quests:
- 3 new words this week; use each once.
- Teach a friend one term.
- Make one flashcard (paper counts!).

Safeguards:
Definitions evolve; stay curious.
