# Astro Knowledge — Pipeline Plan

Purpose: keep the knowledge system growing with quality.

## Streams
1) Foundations expansion (Veda/Vedanga deep dives)
2) Jyotisha core (Signs, Planets, Houses, Nakshatras, Dasha)
3) Applied sciences (Tantra map, Vastu, Graphology, Physiognomy)
4) Practical remedies with evidence trails
5) Cross-cultural links and comparative studies

## Process
- Draft → Review → Validate (schema) → Merge → Publish
- Each item must include sources and limitations
- Prefer smaller, frequent additions over massive drops

## Milestones
- M1: 20 seed entries validated
- M2: Nakshatra manifest + 5 detailed entries
- M3: Planets and Houses basics (12 + 12 summaries)
- M4: First interactive calculator (UI later)
