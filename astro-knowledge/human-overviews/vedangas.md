# Vedangas — Human Overview

Hook:
Six limbs that keep a vast body alive: sound, meter, grammar, etymology, ritual timing, astronomy.

Why it matters:
Vedangas are the tooling layer — precision disciplines that protect meaning and practice.

Scientific cool:
- Linguistics/phonetics: early science of sound.
- Prosody: meter, memory, and cognition.
- Astronomy/calendrics: timing in agricultural and ritual life.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Tajwid (recitation science) preserves sound and meaning.
- Christianity: Liturgical rubrics guard form and intent.
- Sanatan Dharma: Shiksha, Vyakarana, Nirukta, Chandas, Kalpa, Jyotisha.

Mini case:
Learning a bit of sandhi made Sanskrit verses suddenly click.

Level-up Quests:
- Pick one limb; learn one concept well.
- Practice one chant with careful articulation.
- Note your language habits; prune one lazy shortcut.

Safeguards:
Don’t gatekeep. Tools serve understanding.
