# Tantra — Human Overview

Hook:
Not a shortcut. A sovereignty. Tantra teaches you to meet reality as it is — and then shape yourself until you can hold it.

Why it matters:
It unites discipline and devotion, body and breath, mantra and mind. The goal isn’t thrills — it’s integration: power anchored in love.

Scientific cool:
- Breath, mantra, and visualization practices reduce stress and improve emotion regulation.
- Somatic attention enhances interoception and resilience.
- Ritual structure supports habit formation and identity shift.

Story Triad:
- Islam: The Sufi way weds strict ethics with ecstatic love.
- Christianity: Mystics sought union that increased service, not self.
- Sanatan Dharma: Kundalini, mantra, and yantra — technology for transformation.

Mini case:
A daily 12‑minute ritual (breath + mantra + intention) replaced late-night scrolling and rebuilt focus in 30 days.

Level-up Quests:
- 108 mantra reps for 14 days.
- One conscious ritual before sleep.
- Weekly seva: service as spiritual practice.

Safeguards:
Choose teachers who emphasize ethics, boundaries, and humility. Power without truth burns.
