# Yogas (Planetary Combinations) — Human Overview

Hook:
When archetypes team up, new moves appear. Yogas describe synergy — and sometimes friction — between planetary themes.

Why it matters:
Spotting synergy helps design life to your strengths; spotting friction helps build wise buffers.

Scientific cool:
- Systems thinking: interaction effects often outweigh single variables.
- Strengths-based development: leaning into natural combos increases momentum.
- Risk management: address known failure modes early.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Shura (consultation) — power emerges from right combinations of people and timing.
- Christianity: "Where two or three are gathered" — synergy with purpose.
- Sanatan Dharma: Yoga as union — combinations that elevate function.

Mini case:
A Mercury–Venus “teach beautifully” combo became a weekly workshop — career shifted.

Level-up Quests:
- List your top 2 favorable combos and design a tiny project.
- Identify one friction combo; add a safeguard.
- Celebrate one weekly “combo win.”

Safeguards:
No magical guarantees. Design beats daydreaming.
