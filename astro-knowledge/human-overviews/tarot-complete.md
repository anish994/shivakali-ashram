# Tarot — Human Overview

Hook:
78 mirrors, not 78 futures. Cards reflect the questioner — and better questions change lives.

Why it matters:
Tarot can structure reflection, surface blind spots, and encourage wise action when read with ethics.

Scientific cool:
- Projective tools prompt insight through story.
- Choice architecture (“frames”) influences decisions.
- Ritual reduces anxiety and decision fatigue.

Story Triad:
- Islam/Christianity: Discernment and prayer — choose the good.
- Sanatan Dharma: Seek sattva — clarity and responsible action.

Mini case:
The “Tower” didn’t predict doom — it gave permission to exit a bad contract.

Level-up Quests:
- One-card daily reflection.
- Write the action you will take, not the fate you fear.
- Close with gratitude and clarity.

Safeguards:
No fatalism, no dependence. Ethics first.
