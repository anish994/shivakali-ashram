# Planets (Grahas) — Human Overview

Hook:
Think of the planets as archetypal verbs, not distant rocks: to shine, to drive, to learn, to love, to fight, to expand, to discipline, to invent, to dissolve.

Why it matters:
Archetypes help us name patterns we feel but can’t phrase. Learning the grahas gives language to power, love, fear, ambition, and grace.

Scientific cool:
- Astronomy: real cycles, retrogrades, brightness, conjunctions — sky-literacy enriches meaning.
- Psychology: archetypal framing supports narrative re-authoring and goal-setting.
- History: planetary symbolism infused art, medicine, and governance for centuries.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Lunar visibility rules shaped social timing.
- Christianity: Medieval cosmology married planetary symbolism to virtues/temptations.
- Sanatan Dharma: Navagraha worship and remedies anchor discipline and devotion.

Mini case:
A Mars-heavy season reframed as “train, not lash out” saved a friendship.

Level-up Quests:
- Sky watch: spot Venus or Jupiter this month.
- Pick one planet and live its virtue one week.
- Write a letter to your difficult planet — and reply from it.

Safeguards:
Avoid self-fulfilling doom (“I’m cursed”). Choose agency-aligned interpretations.
