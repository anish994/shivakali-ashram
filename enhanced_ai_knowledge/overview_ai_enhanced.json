      {
        "title": "Etymology and Fundamental Concept",
        "content": "Jyotisha (ज्योतिष) derives from 'Jyoti' (light) + 'Isha' (lord/science), literally meaning 'science of light' or 'lord of luminaries.' As a Vedanga, it serves as 'Veda Chakshus' (eye of the Veda), enabling proper timing for ritual activities and spiritual practices. The discipline encompasses three primary branches: 1) Siddhanta - Mathematical astronomy focusing on planetary positions, eclipse calculations, and calendar systems, 2) Samhita - Mundane astrology examining collective phenomena affecting communities and nations, 3) Hora - Natal astrology providing individual guidance based on birth charts. This tripartite division ensures both scientific rigor and practical application."

        "title": "Historical Development and Textual Tradition",
        "content": "Jyotisha evolution spans over three millennia, beginning with Vedanga Jyotisha (1400 BCE) containing basic astronomical algorithms. The Siddhantic period (400-1200 CE) produced sophisticated mathematical treatises like Surya Siddhanta, Aryabhata, and Brahmagupta's works, introducing advanced concepts including sine tables, algebraic methods, and heliocentric theories. The Hora tradition crystallized through Parashara's comprehensive system, later refined by Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita integrating Greek, Roman, and Persian influences. Medieval developments included Bhaskara's mathematical innovations and regional variations across different schools. Modern period witnessed colonial disruption followed by contemporary revival integrating traditional wisdom with modern astronomical precision."
      },
      {
        "title": "Core Astronomical Framework",
        "content": "Jyotisha astronomy employs sophisticated mathematical models for celestial calculations. The geocentric framework recognizes nine primary luminaries (Navagraha): Sun (Surya), Moon (Chandra), Mars (Mangala), Mercury (Budha), Jupiter (Brihaspati), Venus (Shukra), Saturn (Shani), North Node (Rahu), and South Node (Ketu). The zodiac consists of 12 signs (Rashis) of 30 degrees each, beginning with Aries (Mesha). The 27 lunar mansions (Nakshatras) provide finer temporal divisions, each spanning 13°20'. Planetary periods (Dashas) create sophisticated timing systems, with Vimshottari Dasha being most widely used. Mathematical precision includes corrections for precession (Ayanamsha), planetary equations, and geographical variations."

        "title": "Dasha Systems: The Rhythms of Time",
        "content": "Dasha systems provide sophisticated timing mechanisms for predicting life events and spiritual development phases. The Vimshottari Dasha spans 120 years, allocating specific periods to each planet based on Moon's Nakshatra at birth: Sun (6 years), Moon (10), Mars (7), Rahu (18), Jupiter (16), Saturn (19), Mercury (17), Ketu (7), Venus (20). Each Mahadasha subdivides into Antardashas and Pratyantardashas, creating precise timing frameworks. Alternative systems include Ashtottari (108 years), Chara Dasha (based on signs), and Kala Chakra Dasha (incorporating temporal cycles). Advanced practitioners employ multiple Dasha systems simultaneously for comprehensive temporal analysis. The philosophical foundation recognizes time as non-linear consciousness unfoldment rather than mere mechanical progression."
