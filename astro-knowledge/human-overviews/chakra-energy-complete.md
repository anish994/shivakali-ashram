# Chakra Energy Medicine — Human Overview

Hook:
Seven stations, one current. Whether you see chakras as symbols or systems, working with them organizes the inner chaos into clarity.

Why it matters:
As a psychological map, chakras help target practice: safety, creativity, power, love, voice, vision, meaning. Address bottlenecks, unlock flow.

Scientific cool:
- Overlaps with autonomic/endo-crine hubs (plausible correlations explored in psychophysiology).
- Breath + visualization practices reduce stress and improve affect.
- Biofeedback shows users can shift heart coherence with guided imagery.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Sufi latā’if maps subtle centers; remembrance polishes the heart.
- Christianity: Mystical path speaks of purification, illumination, union.
- Sanatan Dharma: Chakra/Tantra texts detail energy centers and practices.

Mini case:
Throat work (humming + honest micro-conversations) ended Maya’s habitual "yes" when she meant "no" — and her jaw stopped aching.

Level-up Quests:
- 5-minute root: feet on ground, slow belly breath.
- Heart add: hand-to-chest, three sincere thank-yous daily.
- Voice drill: one brave honest sentence/day.

Safeguards:
If intense emotions surface, downshift to grounding (feet/breath) and seek support.
