# Case Studies — Human Overview

Hook:
Real people. Real constraints. Real wins — mostly small and steady, the kind that stick.

Why it matters:
Case studies turn abstract systems into human choices. You’ll see trade-offs, timing, and humility in motion.

Scientific cool:
- Behavior science: small steps, tracked, beat big vows.
- Narrative: stories transfer strategies better than tips.
- Social proof: done right, it inspires, not pressures.

Story Triad:
- Across traditions: the best stories end in service.

Mini case:
“Anika” swapped 11 pm doomscrolling for 10-minute japa; sleep + focus returned.

Level-up Quests:
- Pick one micro-change to try for 7 days.
- Write your own mini case; note obstacles and wins.
- Share with someone who will cheer, not judge.

Safeguards:
Privacy first; anonymize details. No health claims.
