# Human Overviews — Legendary App-Ready Summaries

Purpose: lightweight, engaging, human-facing summaries for every subject in astro-knowledge/content. These are designed for the app’s exploration/gamified UI. They keep it fun, deep, credible, and welcoming — without overwhelming the reader.

Format guidelines:
- Hook: 2–3 line punchy opener
- Why it matters (1 short paragraph)
- Scientific cool (3–6 quick bullets with credible anchors)
- Story Triad: Islam • Christianity • Sanatan Dharma (respectful, real, concise)
- Mini case example (1–2 lines)
- Level-up Quests (3–5 bite-size exploration prompts)
- Safeguards (clear, non-alarming)
- Related (IDs of source JSON)

Naming: <subject-id>.md matching the source JSON id.

Example mapping:
- content/jyotisha/planets-complete.json → human-overviews/planets-complete.md
- content/consciousness/meditation-science-complete.json → human-overviews/meditation-science-complete.md

These files do not change the canonical JSON; they complement it for UX.
