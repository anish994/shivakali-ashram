# Palmistry — Human Overview

Hook:
Hands tell stories — of work, play, and tension. Read with humility, not hubris.

Why it matters:
As a reflective practice, palm lines invite conversations about habits and hopes.

Scientific cool:
- No clinical basis for predicting fate; use as guided reflection.
- Grip strength, skin, and posture reflect health behaviors.
- Touch + conversation can reduce anxiety (with consent).

Story Triad:
- Islam/Christianity: Ethics of counsel — do no harm, avoid claims of certainty.
- Sanatan Dharma: Traditional readings framed within dharma and effort.

Mini case:
A “career line” chat became a real resume update and a new interview.

Level-up Quests:
- Map your daily hand use; add variation to prevent strain.
- “Line to habit”: pick one symbolic line and pair with a positive habit.
- Practice consent and kindness in any reading.

Safeguards:
Never diagnose, predict doom, or manipulate.
