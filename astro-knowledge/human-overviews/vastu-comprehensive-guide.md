# Vastu Shastra — Human Overview

Hook:
Design that behaves. Arrange space to calm the nervous system and clarify purpose.

Why it matters:
Small shifts in light, clutter, sound, and flow can create big shifts in mood and productivity.

Scientific cool:
- Environmental psychology: tidiness, daylight, greenery reduce stress.
- Acoustics and airflow influence focus and fatigue.
- Entry/desk orientation cues behavior and boundaries.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Cleanliness and hospitality as spiritual design.
- Christianity: Monastic plans sculpt silence and service.
- Sanatan Dharma: Vastu aligns dwelling with direction and function.

Mini case:
Desk to natural light + plant + cable management → fewer headaches.

Level-up Quests:
- Clear one doorway; remove trip/clutter.
- Add one living element (plant/water/sun).
- Define a tech-off corner.

Safeguards:
Don’t stress about perfection; iterate your space.
