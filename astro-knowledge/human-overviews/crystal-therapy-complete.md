# Crystal Therapy — Human Overview

Hook:
Whether you believe minerals "sing" or simply carry meaning, humans have used stones for memory, ritual, and courage since caves and crowns.

Why it matters:
Crystals can be practical anchors for intention, ritual timing, and mindful touch. Also: they’re beautiful — and beauty itself heals attention.

Scientific cool:
- No strong evidence crystals emit specific healing fields; benefits likely via placebo, symbolism, and touch-mediated calming.
- Placebo isn’t fake — it’s the brain’s self-healing switch (documented across conditions).
- Microelements in some stones are used in tech/medicine — a reminder that matter matters.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Historical talismans and calligraphy-engraved stones for remembrance.
- Christianity: Church reliquaries and gem-inlaid art as devotion and focus.
- Sanatan Dharma: Navaratna gem sets in jyotisha remedies and royal regalia.

Mini case:
A small onyx in pocket → micro-habit: touch it before speaking → fewer impulsive comments.

Level-up Quests:
- One-stone ritual: pick a stone, give it a job for 7 days.
- Wash + reset: weekly clean + re-commit intention.
- Pair with action: stone + breath + 1-minute pause.

Safeguards:
Use crystals as complements, not replacements, for medical care.
