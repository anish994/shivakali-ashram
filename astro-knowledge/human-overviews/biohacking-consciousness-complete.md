# Biohacking & Consciousness — Human Overview

Hook:
Upgrade is a mindset before it’s a gadget. Start with light, sleep, food, breath — then earn the toys.

Why it matters:
Small, evidence-informed tweaks compound into outsized gains in energy, cognition, and mood. Keep what works, drop the hype.

Scientific cool:
- Morning light + sleep consistency outperforms most supplements for alertness.
- Creatine, caffeine (timed), and omega‑3s have robust evidence for cognition/energy.
- Wearables: useful if behavior changes; otherwise, expensive jewelry.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Discipline and sobriety as core virtues — fewer inputs, clearer outputs.
- Christianity: Ascetic practices to refine attention and will.
- Sanatan Dharma: Tapas — voluntary friction for growth.

Mini case:
Three levers (light, bedtime, protein breakfast) → "I feel like a different person" in 21 days.

Level-up Quests:
- One change/week: track energy 1–10.
- Caffeine window: none after 2 pm.
- Creatine trial: 3–5 g/day for 4 weeks.

Safeguards:
Avoid stacking stimulants; mind interactions with meds.
