# Yantras — Human Overview

Hook:
Geometry that prays. Lines and symmetry that tune the mind like a string.

Why it matters:
Yantras offer a visual anchor for attention, a symbolic map for qualities we wish to cultivate, and a bridge between order and awe.

Scientific cool:
- Visual focus reduces mind-wandering and stress.
- Symmetry and fractals are associated with preference and calm in perceptual studies.
- Ritual attention sharpens executive control through repetition.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Sacred geometry adorns mosques — art as remembrance.
- Christianity: Rose windows and cathedral plans encode cosmic order.
- Sanatan Dharma: Sri Yantra revered as a master diagram of reality.

Mini case:
Five minutes of gazing + breath before work reduced doomscrolling and boosted flow.

Level-up Quests:
- Pick one yantra, one week.
- Trace-and-breathe: pencil, slow breath, soft gaze.
- Place it where you begin your day.

Safeguards:
Use yantras respectfully; the tool is attention, not superstition.
