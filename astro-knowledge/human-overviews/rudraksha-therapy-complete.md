# Rudraksha Therapy — Human Overview

Hook:
Beads as breath counters, spine straighteners, and promise keepers.

Why it matters:
Rudraksha malas support mantra discipline and embodied calm. The point isn’t superstition — it’s steadying the mind.

Scientific cool:
- Tactile cues + counting improve adherence in practice.
- Repetitive prayer/chant reduces stress and rumination.
- Posture + breath synergize with mantra.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Misbaha for dhikr — remembrance with beads.
- Christianity: Rosary — meditation through repetition and story.
- Sanatan Dharma: Japa mala — mantra as mind training.

Mini case:
108 reps nightly replaced doomscrolling and soothed sleep.

Level-up Quests:
- One mantra, 40 days.
- Sit tall, slow exhale with each bead.
- Close with gratitude for one person.

Safeguards:
Ethics first; beads don’t replace effort or care.
