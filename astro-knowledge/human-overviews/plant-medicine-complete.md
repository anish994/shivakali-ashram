# Plant Medicine — Human Overview

Hook:
Ancient teachers in modern labs. Powerful, not playful. Respect opens doors; haste trips alarms.

Why it matters:
Emerging clinical use (depression, PTSD, addiction) suggests certain compounds, with proper set/setting and guidance, can catalyze deep therapeutic work.

Scientific cool:
- Clinical trials show promise for treatment-resistant depression and end-of-life anxiety.
- Neuroimaging: increased network flexibility and decreased rigid rumination during sessions.
- Integration practices predict long-term benefit more than the session alone.

Story Triad:
- Islam: The path prizes sobriety; healing is sought through remembrance, patience, and lawful means.
- Christianity: Discernment and shepherded healing; altered states channeled into charity and renewal.
- Sanatan Dharma: Soma hymns point to sacred encounter; Ayurveda centers safety and balance.

Mini case:
Under clinical oversight, a veteran processed a frozen memory and slept through the night for the first time in years.

Level-up Quests:
- Integration first: journaling + breath + therapist/mentor.
- Nature dose: 30 minutes weekly, no phone.
- If not legal/local — don’t. Work foundations instead.

Safeguards:
Legal, medical, and psychological screening are non-negotiable. Never self-medicate serious conditions.
