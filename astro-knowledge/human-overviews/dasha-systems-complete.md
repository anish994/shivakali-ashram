# Dasha Systems — Human Overview

Hook:
Seasons of emphasis. Dasha isn’t fate — it’s which instrument is loudest in the orchestra right now.

Why it matters:
Expecting seasonal themes helps with patience and prioritization. It’s not “good/bad,” it’s “this first, that later.”

Scientific cool:
- Project management: time-boxing and seasonality improve outcomes.
- Cognitive framing: anticipating phases reduces shock and burnout.
- Reflection: periodic reviews improve course correction.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Sacred months shape emphasis (restraint, generosity, remembrance).
- Christianity: Advent/Lent/Easter re-pattern attention and action.
- Sanatan Dharma: Dashas/antardashas as cyclical emphases.

Mini case:
Treating a Saturn period as “craft + boundaries” unlocked slow, durable wins.

Level-up Quests:
- Name your current seasonal priority.
- Drop one task that doesn’t fit this season.
- Schedule a review two months out.

Safeguards:
Avoid “waiting out life.” Use seasons to act wisely, not to avoid acting.
