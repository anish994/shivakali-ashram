# Rashis (Zodiac Signs) — Human Overview

Hook:
Not stereotypes — strategies. Each sign is a way of moving through life: cardinal spark, fixed depth, mutable bridge.

Why it matters:
Knowing your style (and others’) reduces conflict and improves collaboration. It’s social aikido, not destiny.

Scientific cool:
- Personality science: traits are useful heuristics, not cages.
- Communication: explicit preference-sharing boosts team outcomes.
- Habit change: identity-based framing supports consistency.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Adab (courtesy) tailors speech to context and person.
- Christianity: Different gifts, one body — collaboration over competition.
- Sanatan Dharma: Gunas as modes of expression shaped by practice.

Mini case:
Labeling a teammate as “fixed depth” changed meetings from clashes to clear roles.

Level-up Quests:
- Identify your primary style in conflict.
- Try the opposite for one low-stakes task.
- Praise someone in their native style.

Safeguards:
No type-shaming. People > labels. Growth is normal.
