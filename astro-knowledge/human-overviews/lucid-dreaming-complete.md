# Lucid Dreaming — Human Overview

Hook:
Wake up while you’re still asleep. Rewrite nightmares. Practice courage. Meet the psyche where it plays.

Why it matters:
Lucidity gives access to rehearsal, healing, and creativity. It’s neurocognitive training with a cinema-grade simulator.

Scientific cool:
- Lab-verified lucidity (volitional eye signals) since LaBerge’s work.
- MILD/SSILD techniques improve lucidity rates in controlled studies.
- Rehearsal in dreams improves waking motor/cognitive performance.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Righteous dreams are a portion of prophecy in hadith literature.
- Christianity: Scriptural dreams guided Joseph; saints recorded visionary sleep.
- Sanatan Dharma: Yoga Nidra and dream yoga — awareness across states.

Mini case:
A recurring chase switched to a calm turn-around; the nightmare never returned.

Level-up Quests:
- Reality checks: 5/day.
- Dream journal: 3 lines on waking.
- MILD: rehearse "I’ll know I’m dreaming" as you fall asleep.

Safeguards:
Mind your sleep hygiene; avoid sleep deprivation and stimulant chaos.
