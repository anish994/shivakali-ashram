# Physiognomy — Human Overview (Ethical Frame)

Hook:
Humans are pattern-seeking — sometimes too much. If you explore face-reading, do it to train empathy, not prejudice.

Why it matters:
Attention to micro-expressions can improve listening. But history shows how dangerous misuses become.

Scientific cool:
- Emotion recognition has context limits; avoid overconfidence.
- Bias awareness training helps reduce snap judgments.
- Active listening improves outcomes far more than guessing.

Story Triad:
- Islam/Christianity/Sanatan Dharma: Judge with justice, humility, and care — the heart matters more than the face.

Mini case:
Shifting from “type” to “ask a better question” saved a tense meeting.

Level-up Quests:
- Notice one assumption; replace with a question.
- Mirror practice: soften your own face before conflict.
- Keep a “what I learned by asking” log.

Safeguards:
Never profile, stereotype, or discriminate. People are not templates.
