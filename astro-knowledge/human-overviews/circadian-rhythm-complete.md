# Circadian Rhythm — Human Overview

Hook:
Your body runs on sunlight code. Respect the clock or pay interest with mood, hunger, and fog.

Why it matters:
Aligning light, food, and activity with circadian biology boosts energy, sleep, and metabolic health. It’s Ayurveda meets Nobel science.

Scientific cool:
- 2017 Nobel Prize recognized the genes that govern circadian clocks.
- Morning light anchors the suprachiasmatic nucleus; late-night blue light scrambles it.
- Time-restricted eating improves insulin sensitivity and weight regulation in trials.

Story Triad:
- Islam: Fajr to Isha — a day scaffolded by prayer times and light.
- Christianity: Monastic hours mark dawn, noon, dusk — time as devotion.
- Sanatan Dharma: Brahma muhūrta — predawn as prime for clarity.

Mini case:
Two weeks of 15-min morning sun + earlier dinners → deeper sleep, kinder mornings.

Level-up Quests:
- Sun-on-skin: 5–10 minutes within an hour of waking.
- Kitchen curfew: stop calories 3 hours before bed.
- Night mode: warm lights after sunset.

Safeguards:
Shift workers: adapt in cycles and protect sleep aggressively.
