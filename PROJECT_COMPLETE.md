// Spiritual AI Integration
async function getAIGuidance(userQuestion) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/spiritual_guidance', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ inquiry: userQuestion })
        });
        
        const data = await response.json();
        return data.success ? data.response : null;
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('AI Guidance Error:', error);
        return null;
    }
}
