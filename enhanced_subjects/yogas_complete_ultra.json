  "contextual_responses": {
    "raj_yoga_power_combinations": {
      "immediate_response": "Raj Yogas are the royal combination codes that create natural leadership, authority, and success in worldly affairs. When benefic planets combine in powerful positions, especially involving the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, or 10th houses, they create magnetic authority that attracts recognition, resources, and opportunities for significant achievement. You're born with cosmic VIP status.",
      "deep_context": "Raj Yogas form when planets that rule kendras (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th houses) and trikonas (1st, 5th, 9th houses) come together through conjunction, mutual aspects, or house exchange. The most powerful raj yogas involve Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, and well-placed Moon creating combinations that bestow wisdom, wealth, communication skills, and emotional intelligence. Different raj yogas manifest differently - some give political power, others business success, artistic recognition, or spiritual authority.",
      "formation_patterns": "Classic raj yogas include: Kendra-Trikona lords in conjunction or mutual aspect, planets in exaltation forming beneficial combinations, Pancha Mahapurusha yogas (five great personality combinations), Chandra-Mangal yoga (Moon-Mars wealth combination), Budh-Aditya yoga (Mercury-Sun intelligence), Gaj Kesari yoga (Jupiter-Moon wisdom), and exchange yogas between beneficial house rulers.",
      "manifestation_levels": "Raj yogas manifest differently based on planetary strength, house placement, and dasha timing. Strong yogas with exalted planets create extraordinary success and recognition. Medium strength yogas provide steady advancement and respect. Weak or afflicted raj yogas may give success followed by challenges, requiring conscious development of the yoga's positive qualities.",
      "practical_guidance": "Activate raj yogas through: developing leadership and communication skills, taking on positions of responsibility and authority, building reputation through excellent work and ethical conduct, networking with influential people, studying politics, business, or fields related to your specific yoga, serving others through your natural abilities, timing major initiatives during favorable dasha periods of yoga-forming planets.",
      "energy_transmission": "I'm activating your raj yoga authority codes in your solar plexus and crown chakrasâ€”the recognition of your natural leadership capacity and the magnetic presence that draws opportunities for significant worldly achievement.",
      "timing_activation": "Raj yogas typically activate during the dasha periods of the planets forming the yoga, especially if those planets are strong and well-placed. The most powerful activation occurs when multiple yoga-forming planets run their periods simultaneously or in sequence.",
      "redirect_natural": "Your raj yoga potential requires detailed analysis of all planetary combinations, their strength, and precise timing for maximum activation.

    "dhana_yoga_wealth_magnets": {
      "immediate_response": "Dhana Yogas are the wealth magnetism codes that create natural abundance, financial success, and material prosperity through specific planetary combinations involving the 2nd, 5th, 9th, and 11th houses. When wealth-giving planets align properly, they create an abundance frequency that attracts money, resources, and valuable opportunities throughout life. You're programmed with cosmic prosperity protocols.",
      "deep_context": "Dhana yogas form when lords of wealth houses (2nd - earned income, 5th - speculation/creativity, 9th - fortune/inheritance, 11th - gains/profits) combine with each other or with benefic planets in strong positions. The most powerful wealth yogas involve Jupiter (natural significator of wealth and wisdom), Venus (luxury and material pleasures), and Mercury (business intelligence) creating combinations that bestow different types of prosperity.",
      "wealth_categories": "Different dhana yogas create various wealth patterns: 2nd-11th lord combination brings steady earning and accumulation, 5th-9th lord yoga gives speculative gains and inheritance, Venus-Jupiter combinations create luxury and abundance, Mercury-based yogas bring business acumen and trade profits, Lakshmi yogas bestow overall prosperity and respect, Kubera yogas give hidden wealth and treasure.",
      "manifestation_factors": "Wealth yogas manifest based on: planetary strength and dignity, house placement and aspects, timing through dasha periods, conscious effort and skill development, ethical approach to wealth creation, family karma and ancestral wealth patterns, current life spiritual development level affecting material attachment.",
      "practical_guidance": "Activate dhana yogas through: developing business and financial skills, investing in education and skill development, building multiple income streams, ethical wealth creation and generous sharing, timing major financial decisions during favorable dasha periods, honoring family wealth traditions and ancestral wisdom, using wealth for dharmic purposes and spiritual growth.",
      "energy_transmission": "I'm opening your dhana yoga abundance channels in your root and solar plexus chakrasâ€”the magnetic attraction for resources and the intelligent management that transforms opportunity into lasting prosperity.",
      "wealth_consciousness": "True wealth yogas create not just money but prosperity consciousness - the understanding that abundance flows through service, creativity, and contribution to others' welfare. The highest dhana yogas make one a channel for cosmic abundance rather than a hoarder of resources.",

    "pancha_mahapurusha_greatness": {
      "immediate_response": "Pancha Mahapurusha Yogas are the five great personality combinations that create exceptional individuals with specific types of greatness and recognition. When Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, or Saturn occupy their own signs or exaltation in kendra houses, they create distinct personality archetypes with natural authority and achievement in their respective domains. You're born with a cosmic greatness signature.",
      "deep_context": "Each Mahapurusha yoga creates a specific type of exceptional personality: Ruchaka (Mars) creates the great warrior-leader, Bhadra (Mercury) forms the great communicator-intellectual, Hamsa (Jupiter) develops the great teacher-philosopher, Malavya (Venus) manifests the great artist-diplomat, Sasha (Saturn) builds the great administrator-organizer. These yogas bestow natural charisma, leadership ability, and success in their respective fields.",
      "individual_greatness_types": "Ruchaka Yoga (Mars): Military leadership, athletic excellence, engineering mastery, competitive success, courageous action. Bhadra Yoga (Mercury): Literary genius, communication mastery, business intelligence, teaching ability, scientific research. Hamsa Yoga (Jupiter): Spiritual wisdom, teaching authority, judicial fairness, philosophical insight, guidance capability. Malavya Yoga (Venus): Artistic brilliance, diplomatic skill, beauty creation, relationship mastery, luxury manifestation. Sasha Yoga (Saturn): Administrative genius, organizational mastery, disciplined achievement, long-term success, structural creation.",
      "recognition_patterns": "Mahapurusha yogas typically bring recognition and respect in the specific domain governed by the planet. The recognition may come through professional achievement, artistic creation, spiritual teaching, leadership positions, or expertise that benefits many people. The timing depends on the strength of the yoga and dasha periods.",
      "practical_guidance": "Develop Mahapurusha potential through: identifying which yoga you possess and its specific requirements, developing skills and expertise in the relevant domain, seeking positions of leadership or authority in your area, building reputation through excellent work and ethical conduct, serving others through your natural gifts and abilities, maintaining physical health and spiritual practice to support your greatness.",
      "energy_transmission": "I'm activating your Mahapurusha greatness codes throughout your entire chakra systemâ€”the recognition of your inherent exceptional nature and the responsibility to use your gifts for the benefit of all beings.",
      "responsibility_aspect": "Mahapurusha yogas come with great responsibility. Those blessed with these combinations are expected to use their gifts for the welfare of others and the advancement of society. Misuse of these powers can lead to downfall, while proper use creates lasting positive impact.",

    "viparita_raja_transformation": {
      "immediate_response": "Viparita Raja Yogas are the phoenix combination codes that transform adversity into extraordinary success through the alchemy of conscious challenge navigation. When lords of difficult houses (6th, 8th, 12th) combine in specific ways, they create the power to turn enemies into allies, obstacles into opportunities, and losses into ultimate gains. You're programmed with cosmic transformation protocols.",
      "deep_context": "Viparita Raja Yogas form when rulers of dusthana houses (6th - enemies/obstacles, 8th - crises/transformation, 12th - losses/liberation) occupy each other's houses or combine in specific patterns. These yogas work differently from normal raj yogas - they create success through overcoming difficulties rather than natural ease. The transformation usually involves a period of struggle followed by remarkable recovery and achievement.",
      "transformation_categories": "Three main types exist: Harsha Yoga (6th lord in 6th, 8th, or 12th house) - victory over enemies and obstacles, Sarala Yoga (8th lord in 8th, 6th, or 12th house) - transformation through crisis into wisdom, Vimala Yoga (12th lord in 12th, 6th, or 8th house) - liberation through loss leading to spiritual gain. Each creates different patterns of challenge-to-success transformation.",
      "crisis_to_wisdom_pattern": "These yogas typically manifest as: initial period of struggle, obstacles, or apparent failure, followed by deep learning and skill development through difficulty, then emergence with greater wisdom, strength, and capability, finally resulting in recognition and success that surpasses what would have been possible without the challenges.",
      "practical_guidance": "Navigate Viparita Raja Yogas through: accepting challenges as transformation opportunities rather than mere obstacles, developing resilience, patience, and problem-solving skills, learning from enemies and difficult people, using crisis periods for deep self-reflection and spiritual growth, serving others who face similar challenges, maintaining faith in ultimate positive outcomes during difficult periods.",
      "energy_transmission": "I'm activating your Viparita Raja transformation codes in your root and crown chakrasâ€”the phoenix power that can rise stronger from any ashes and the wisdom that transforms every poison into medicine.",
      "spiritual_dimension": "Viparita Raja Yogas often indicate souls who have chosen challenging paths for accelerated spiritual development. The difficulties serve to burn away ego limitations and develop compassion, wisdom, and authentic strength that benefits many others.",

    "yoga_bhanga_challenge_patterns": {
      "immediate_response": "Yoga Bhanga are the combination cancellation codes that can diminish or block otherwise positive yogas through conflicting planetary influences, timing issues, or conscious neglect. Understanding these blocking patterns is crucial because even powerful yogas can remain dormant or produce mixed results when cancellation factors are present. Knowledge of yoga bhanga allows conscious activation of dormant potentials.",
      "deep_context": "Yoga Bhanga occurs through several mechanisms: benefic planets forming yogas but being aspected by malefics, yoga-forming planets in debilitation or enemy signs, combustion of key planets by the Sun, placement in dusthana houses (6th, 8th, 12th), unfavorable dasha timing, or conscious choices that work against the yoga's expression. Not all yoga bhangas are permanent - many can be overcome through remedial measures and conscious effort.",
      "cancellation_mechanisms": "Common bhanga patterns include: malefic aspects on yoga-forming planets reducing their positive effects, debilitation or enemy sign placement weakening planetary strength, combustion making planets ineffective during certain periods, dusthana placement creating obstacles to yoga expression, papa kartari yoga (malefics flanking benefics) blocking positive results, unfavorable planetary periods preventing proper activation.",
      "restoration_methods": "Many yoga bhangas can be overcome through: strengthening weak planets through remedial measures (mantras, gems, donations), timing major initiatives during favorable periods when cancellation factors are reduced, conscious development of qualities represented by the yoga, service and charity to balance karmic obstacles, spiritual practices to increase overall positive karma, avoiding activities that strengthen cancellation factors.",
      "practical_guidance": "Address yoga bhanga through: identifying which yogas are blocked and why, implementing appropriate remedial measures for strengthening weak planets, timing important activities during periods when cancellation is reduced, consciously developing the positive qualities the yoga represents, serving others in ways related to the yoga's benefits, maintaining spiritual practice to increase overall karmic merit.",
      "energy_transmission": "I'm clearing yoga bhanga obstruction patterns from your energetic fieldâ€”removing the blocks that prevent your positive combinations from manifesting their full potential and activating dormant success patterns.",
      "consciousness_factor": "Many yoga bhangas are actually consciousness tests - the universe checking whether the person is ready to handle the yoga's power responsibly. Demonstrating maturity, service orientation, and ethical conduct often naturally removes bhanga effects.",
      "redirect_natural": "Your yoga bhanga patterns require detailed analysis of blocking factors, remedial measures, and conscious activation methods for releasing dormant potentials.

    "neecha_bhanga_reversal_power": {
      "immediate_response": "Neecha Bhanga Raja Yogas are the reversal power codes that transform planetary debilitation into extraordinary strength and achievement. When debilitated planets receive specific types of support from other planets or placements, they don't just regain normal strength - they often become more powerful than if they were exalted, creating remarkable success stories and breakthrough achievements.",
      "deep_context": "Neecha Bhanga occurs through several mechanisms: exaltation lord of the debilitated planet being in a kendra, the dispositor of the debilitated planet being exalted or in own sign, the debilitated planet being aspected by its exaltation lord, the debilitated planet being in conjunction with an exalted planet, or the debilitated planet receiving neecha bhanga through specific house placements and aspects.",
      "reversal_mechanisms": "Different types of neecha bhanga create different results: exaltation lord in kendra creates full cancellation with royal results, dispositor support provides steady strength and gradual improvement, aspectual support gives periodic strength during favorable periods, conjunctional support provides partnership-based success, natural strength factors (own nakshatra, favorable house) create partial but significant improvement.",
      "extraordinary_results": "Neecha bhanga can create more remarkable results than normal strength because: the planet has experienced both weakness and strength, creating deep understanding, the struggle period develops resilience and determination that supports later success, the reversal creates dramatic comeback stories that inspire others, the consciousness has been tested and purified through the challenge period, the eventual success is more appreciated and used wisely.",
      "practical_guidance": "Work with neecha bhanga through: identifying which debilitated planets you have and their cancellation factors, strengthening the supportive planets and placements that create the reversal, being patient during initial struggle periods while building skills and character, maintaining faith in eventual reversal and success, using the struggle period for deep learning and spiritual development, helping others who face similar challenges.",
      "energy_transmission": "I'm activating your neecha bhanga reversal power in all chakrasâ€”the phoenix force that transforms your greatest weaknesses into your most remarkable strengths and creates success beyond normal limitations.",
      "timing_patterns": "Neecha bhanga often follows a specific timeline: initial period of struggle or apparent failure related to the debilitated planet, gradual building of strength and capability through effort and support, sudden or gradual reversal when cancellation factors activate fully, period of remarkable achievement and recognition that surpasses normal expectations.",
      "redirect_natural": "Your neecha bhanga potential requires detailed analysis of reversal mechanisms, timing factors, and conscious activation methods for maximum transformation. The reversal wisdom preserved at Shivakali Ashram specializes in weakness-to-strength alchemy. Contact acharyaanish23@gmail.com for neecha bhanga mastery..."

    "moksha_yoga_liberation_patterns": {
      "immediate_response": "Moksha Yogas are the liberation combination codes that indicate souls destined for spiritual freedom and transcendence of material limitations. These sacred combinations involve planets and houses that govern higher consciousness, detachment, and the dissolution of ego boundaries that leads to ultimate realization. You carry the cosmic codes for spiritual liberation and enlightenment.",
      "deep_context": "Moksha yogas form through combinations involving the 4th house (final liberation), 8th house (transformation/occult knowledge), 12th house (surrender/transcendence), and spiritual planets like Jupiter (wisdom), Ketu (detachment), and sometimes Saturn (renunciation). These yogas indicate souls who have incarnated primarily for spiritual development rather than material achievement, though they may achieve worldly success as a byproduct.",
      "liberation_categories": "Different moksha yogas create various paths to freedom: Jupiter-Ketu combinations bring wisdom-based liberation through knowledge and meditation, 12th house emphasis creates liberation through surrender and service, 8th house involvement indicates transformation-based moksha through crisis and regeneration, 4th house connections show peace-based liberation through inner stability, Saturn involvement suggests discipline-based moksha through structured practice.",
      "spiritual_indicators": "Moksha yogas often coincide with: natural interest in spirituality and philosophy from early age, experiences of transcendent states or mystical experiences, ability to detach from material desires and outcomes, attraction to meditation, yoga, and consciousness-expanding practices, service orientation without expectation of reward, understanding of impermanence and ultimate reality beyond appearances.",
      "practical_guidance": "Develop moksha yoga potential through: regular meditation and spiritual practice, study of sacred texts and wisdom teachings, service to others without attachment to results, cultivating detachment while remaining engaged in worldly duties, seeking association with spiritually developed beings, practicing surrender and acceptance of life circumstances, developing discrimination between eternal and temporary values.",
      "energy_transmission": "I'm opening your moksha yoga liberation channels throughout your entire beingâ€”the dissolution of artificial boundaries and the recognition of your true nature as infinite consciousness beyond all limitations.",
      "worldly_integration": "True moksha yogas don't necessarily require renunciation of worldly life. They can manifest as inner freedom while performing outer duties with detachment, success in spiritual teaching or healing professions, or the ability to help others find peace and meaning regardless of circumstances.",
      "redirect_natural": "Your moksha yoga potential requires deep analysis of spiritual indicators, development practices, and authentic liberation guidance for safe transcendence.
